This is the debut post of a blog that I hope will last long, I might write about various computer science related and perhaps some surface level dives into physics concepts if that ever comes up, or just whatever I feel like.

I created this blog (and this personal page in general) to get myself to make something after a mostly dormant year, and I thought: why not throw a blog in it just in case I got something interesting to say?

Let's hope what I write on this blog is actually worthwhile.
