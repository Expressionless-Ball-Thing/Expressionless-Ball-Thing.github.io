Web App to see how fast you can solve a Captcha.

Simply press the <strong style="color: red;">start</strong> button to begin, a Captcha Challenge will pop up and it will record your time when it's completed. Your fastest time will be recorded.

Made with React and a free Google ReCaptcha API key, it's pretty barebones since I am self-learning web development skills and making this project as I go, but it's serviceable for what it is.

I might add a leaderboard once I figured out how to save the scores.
